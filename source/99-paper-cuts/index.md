## What is the 99 Papercut Project?

**Papercuts are fast to fix, but annoying bugs. The mission of the 99 papercut project is to reduce those bugs to make Shopware even better.**

## Get involved!

In the two weeks from Monday the 5th September to Monday the 19th September we would like to fix as many papercut bugs as possible together with our community.

### How to contribute?

1. Join our IRC channel for direct communication with us and the rest of the community.
2. Find a papercut that you want to fix from the existing papercuts.
3. Create a Pull Request on [Github](https://github.com/shopware/shopware).

## How to submit a Papercut

Papercuts can be reported via our [Issue Tracker](https://issues.shopware.com). Please choose "Papercut" as the Shopware Version when submitting a new papercut.

## Existing Papercuts

You can also see all <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.shopware.com/99-paper-cuts">existing papercuts</a> in the issue tracker.

## Communication

The best tool to directly communicate with the community and shopware developers is the [\#shopware IRC Channel](/contributing/irc).
During the time of the papercut project we will be particularly active there to help you with your pull requests.

## Brag about it on Twitter
